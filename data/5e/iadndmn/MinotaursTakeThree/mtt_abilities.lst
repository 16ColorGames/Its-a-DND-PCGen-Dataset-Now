The DM describes the scene truthfully (though not necessarily completely), as a vision only you can see which lasts up to 1 minute, or until the scene is resolved. You can request that the fates (the DM) show you a vision concerning a particular subject or event, but they are not obliged to do so. You cannot see creatures, objects, or areas that are magically warded, or otherwise protected from divination magic. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you complete the Long Rest after your next Long Rest.
