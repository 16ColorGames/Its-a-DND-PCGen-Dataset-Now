## Items
Floating Lantern	TYPE:Magic.Uncommon.Wondrous item		SPROP:Existing in both hooded lantern and bullseye lantern varieties, this magic lantern functions identically to their mundane counterparts, except for the fact that while they are lit, they levitate magically in the air. While lit, if you release your grasp on the lantern, it will remain in the air at the level at which it was released, and if the last person to hold the lanter moves more than 5 feet away from it, it will hover to follow that person, taking the shortest possible route to do so until it is within 5 feet of them again, at which point it stops moving. If the person that a floating lantern is following is ever further than 60 feet away from the lantern, or if the lantern is prevented from moving, it extinguishes itself, gently floating to the ground in its current place.
Ghast Candle		TYPE:Magic.Very Rare.Wondrous item		SPROP:The wax of this candle is white with deep crimson marbling, and produces a deep red light and strong copperish smell while it burns. A creature that starts its turn within the candle's bright light has advantage on attack rolls made against undead creatures until the end of that turn. The ghast candle burns exceptionally fast, such that it has half the maximum possible duration as a normal candle.
Ghost Candle		TYPE:Magic.Rare.Wondrous item		SPROP:This soft, blue candle produces an acrid smell and pale blue light while it burns, both of which are undetectable by undead creatures. Creatures in the area of the candle's bright light are invisible to undead creatures, and creatures in the area of the candle's dim light are considered heavily obscured to undead creatures, regardless of whether an undead creature has darkvision.
Ghoul Candle		TYPE:Magic.Uncommon.Wondrous item		SPROP:This soft, milky-white candle produces a pungent, rotten odor and soft violet light while it burns. Undead creatures that enter the candle's light for the first time on their turn, or that start their turn there must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A creature paralyzed by a ghoul candle can repeat its save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its save, or for which the effect ends is immune to the effects of ghoul candles for 24 hours.

## Attunement Items
Eyeglobe	TYPE:Wondrous Item.Uncommon.Attunement		DEFINE:Attunement_Eyeglobe|0	BONUS:VAR|Attunement_Eyeglobe|1		SPROP:Not attuned to Item|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Attunement,Eyeglobe	SPROP:This 3-inch-diameter sphere of solid glass contains a spot or ribbon of colored glass within it, causing the globe to resemble a large glass eyeball. As an action, you can hold the globe in your hand and speak its command word to activate its magic. For as long as you maintain concentration on the effect (as if concentrating on a spell), you are deafened and can only see through the globe. You see through the globe's perspective using any darkvision you may have, but without the benefit of any other special senses you might possess. You can concentrate on the effect for up to 10 minutes, and once per round, you can use your action to cause the globe to roll up to 10 feet in a direction you choose, continuing to see through it as it moves. If the globe falls from a height of greater than 5 feet, or suffers some other equivalent physical shock, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain the effect. The DC of this saving throw is equal to the number of feet it fell, or equal to the bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage it would be dealt (if from an attack or hazard). The globe is indestructible by normal means, but can be easily picked up, covered, or otherwise thwarted by a creature that notices it. You can make Intelligence (Stealth) checks at disadvantage to try and move the globe undetected past creatures not aware of its presence. Once the globe is activated, it can't be activated again until the following dawn.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Attunement,Eyeglobe
